This project aims to predict future sales of a retail store using machine learning techniques. First we convert our raw data to processed data and then we use the processed data csv, in this step we merged same order ID's to a single order to ensure uniformity in dataset. Next we begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and detect anomalies within the dataset. Outliers were identified and handled to ensure data integrity, followed by feature engineering steps including one-hot encoding of categorical variables. A Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model was employed for training and prediction. After fitting the model, various visual and analytical techniques were applied to evaluate and interpret the results. The approach demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively leveraged for retail forecasting using a refined and well-preprocessed dataset.
